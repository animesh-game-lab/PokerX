## 🃏 The Game: Rules & Etiquette

Whether you're a newcomer or a seasoned pro, understanding the game is the first step to victory.

### The Objective

The goal is simple: win the pot by having the **best five-card hand** at the showdown, or by getting all other players to **fold**.

### The Game Flow

1.  **The Ante/Blinds:** The game starts with players placing initial bets (blinds or antes) to create the pot.
2.  **The Deal:** Each player receives their initial cards (e.g., two in Texas Hold'em).
3.  **The Betting Rounds:**
    * **Pre-Flop:** The first round of betting before any community cards are dealt.
    * **The Flop:** Three community cards are dealt face-up, followed by another betting round.
    * **The Turn:** A fourth community card is dealt, followed by a betting round.
    * **The River:** The final community card is dealt, followed by the last betting round.
4.  **The Showdown:** If more than one player remains, they reveal their hands, and the best hand wins the pot.

### Hand Rankings

* **Royal Flush:** A, K, Q, J, 10, all of the same suit.
* **Straight Flush:** Five cards in sequence, all of the same suit.
* **Four of a Kind:** Four cards of the same rank.
* **Full House:** Three of a kind and a pair.
* **Flush:** Five cards of the same suit.
* **Straight:** Five cards in sequence.
* ...and so on.
